	<p>Set the phases to rot<br>
	What has got you distraught?<br>
	It's negative attention at best<br>
	But call it nothing</p>

	<p>Maybe it's something, a little bit, a little bit<br>
	Maybe it's something, do a little bit<br>
	It's all about ascension, I guess<br>
	Don't put me to rest</p>

	<p>Go on and hand me your clothes (oh, here you go)<br>
	Take a picture or two (two or three?)<br>
	I can see you (oh)</p>

	<p>Tears falling down at the party<br>
	Saddest little baby in the room<br>
	Fears, tell me fears, don't get me started<br>
	I get a little grey hair for every scare you share</p>
	<p>Those aren't meant to bend<br>
No, those aren't meant to bend<br>
Those aren't meant to bend<br>
No, those aren't meant to bend</p>

<p>I hear your eyes and I see those cries<br>
I hear those eyes and I see those cries<br>
I can't be the only one who hears you<br>
Tears falling down at the party</p>

<p>Saddest little baby in the room<br>
Fears, tell me fears, don't get me started<br>
I get a little gray hair for every scare you share<br>
Those aren't meant to bend</p>

<p>No, those aren't meant to bend<br>
Those aren't mean to bend<br>
No, those aren't meant to bend<br>
Tears falling down at the party</p>

<p>Saddest little baby in my eye<br>
Fears, tell me fears, don't get me started<br>
I might die</p>
